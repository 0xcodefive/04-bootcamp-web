# Hello dear frends

Welcome to our exciting NFT project, exclusively created for Boot Camp participants! Our collection boasts a unique Zero2Hero 0xC0DE token that can be minted through staking your NFTs. What's more, every transaction of the Zero2Hero 0xC0DE token incurs a commission, ensuring its stability and value growth.

But that's not all - our NFT Utility is the key to unlocking even greater value for our participants. It allows you to trade and make transactions with your NFTs, earning you exclusive ECR20 tokens with every stake submission. These tokens can be used to acquire more NFTs from our collection, or traded on cryptocurrency exchanges for even greater rewards!

By using our NFT Utility, you'll enjoy a whole new level of functionality and value, making our NFT collection even more attractive to potential buyers. It's the perfect way to earn additional ECR20 tokens, and make the most out of your participation in our Boot Camp program.

So join us now and be part of this incredible journey!

##

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install ethers@5.7.2 @web3modal/ethereum @web3modal/html wagmi
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
